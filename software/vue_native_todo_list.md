# Coding Exercise: Vue Native Todo List

> "Don't repeat yourself. It's not only repetitive, it's redundant, and people have heard it before." â€” Lemony Snicket

## Overview

Your (perhaps crazy) boss has decided that the million todo app's in the world just aren't cutting it and so you're team is going to make another one.
"This is a daring project sure to change the world" your boss says, though your opinion probably differs.
Anyways, some of your team uses iPhones while others use Android phones, so of course you'll need to support both!
The company you work at is a Vue.js shop and so you've been tasked to build the first iteration of the MVP in Vue.js.
The expected functionality for this first iterations is:

1. A user can can add new todos with a name for each.
2. A user can delete todos.
3. A user can re-order the list.

## Deliverables

Provide a Github repository which contains your Vue Native Todo List project.
