# Coding Exercise: UI with Cards and Swim Lanes

> "Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." â€• Albert Einstein

## Overview

You've decided that you're going to stop paying all your monthly service subscription costs and build all your productivity tools yourself.
This is a bold move to be sure and one that will probably keep you busy for some time.
Your first tool to build is a basic swim lane style organization tool with cards.
There will be three swim lanes that each have titles, which can be edited.
You can add cards and give it a title, move cards, and delete cards.
Of course, you're a very design minded person, so the tool should look half decent and that way you won't be tempted to pay for ~Trello~ whatever was that tool you were using.
Feel free to use open source libraries in building this application.

## Deliverables

Provide a Github repository which contains your Swimlane Board project.
